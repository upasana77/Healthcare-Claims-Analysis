This repository contains my claims cost & utilization analysis project using SQL Server and Power BI.

## Files Included
- claims_analysis.sql — SQL queries (basic + intermediate + advanced)
- Healthcare_Claims_Data.xlsx — dataset used for analysis
- Dashboard screenshots — Power BI visuals (KPI cards + charts)

## Skills Used
- SQL Server (aggregation, filtering, grouping)
- Power BI (DAX, slicers, KPIs)
- Excel for data cleaning
- Healthcare claims analysis

## Insights Found
- Cancer was the highest cost driver ($16.4K).
- ER + Inpatient services generated most spend.
- Hypertension & Diabetes showed repeated utilization.

This project reflects similar analytics work I performed at CVS Health and AHRC Nassau.
